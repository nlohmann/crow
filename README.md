[**Sentry**](https://sentry.io/welcome/) is such a useful tool, but there is currently [no official support](https://sentry.io/platforms/) for C++. **Crow** is an official Sentry client for C++ that tries to fill this gap to allow for Sentry notifications in long-running C++ applications where you do not want to constantly look at log files.

## API

- `crow::crow(dsn, attributes=null, install_handlers=true)` to create a client
- `crow::capture_message(message, options=nullptr, async=true)` to send a message
- `crow::capture_exception(exception, async=true, handled=true)` to send an exception
- `crow::add_breadcrumb(message, type="default")` to add a breadcrumb

## Requirements for Sentry SDKs

The following items from [the SDK implementation guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/overview/#writing-an-sdk) are realized at the moment:

- The following items are expected of production-ready SDKs:
    - [x] DSN configuration
    - [ ] Graceful failures (e.g. Sentry server is unreachable)
    - [ ] Setting attributes (e.g. tags and extra data)
    - [ ] Support for Linux, Windows and OS X (where applicable)
- Feature based support is required for the following:
    - [ ] If cookie data is available, it’s not sent by default
    - [ ] If POST data is available, it’s not sent by default
- Additionally, the following features are highly encouraged:
    - [x] Automated error capturing (e.g. uncaught exception handlers)
    - [ ] Logging framework integration
    - [x] Non-blocking event submission
    - [ ] Basic data sanitization (e.g. filtering out values that look like passwords)
    - [ ] Context data helpers (e.g. setting the current user, recording breadcrumbs)
    - [ ] Event sampling
    - [ ] Honor Sentry’s HTTP 429 Retry-After header
    - [ ] Pre and Post event send hooks
    - [ ] Local variable values in stacktrace (on platforms where this is possible)

## Prerequisites

You need [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) and a C++11 compiler to use the library.

## Used third-party tools

The library itself consists of a single header file licensed under the MIT license. However, it is built, tested, documented, and whatnot using a lot of third-party tools and services. Thanks a lot!

- [**Artistic Style**](http://astyle.sourceforge.net) for automatic source code identation
- [**Cmake**](https://cmake.org) for build automation
- [**Doxygen**](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to generate documentation
- [**JSON for Modern C++**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to use JSON datatypes inside C++
- [**libcurl**](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) for HTTP communication with the Sentry servers
- [**Sole**](https://github.com/r-lyeh-archived/sole) to generate UUIDs
