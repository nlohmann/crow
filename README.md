[**Sentry**](https://sentry.io/welcome/) is such a useful tool, but there is currently [no official support](https://sentry.io/platforms/) for C++. **Crow** is an official Sentry client for C++ that tries to fill this gap to allow for Sentry notifications in long-running C++ applications where you do not want to constantly look at log files.

## API

### Setup

- `nlohmann::crow::crow(dsn, context={}, install_handlers=true)` to create a client
- `nlohmann::crow::install_handler()` to later install termination handler

### Reporting

- `nlohmann::crow::capture_message(message, attributes={}, async=true)` to send a message
- `nlohmann::crow::capture_exception(exception, context={}, async=true, handled=true)` to send an exception
- `nlohmann::crow::add_breadcrumb(message, attributes={})` to add a breadcrumb
- `nlohmann::crow::get_last_event_id()` to get the id of the last event

### Context management

- `nlohmann::crow::get_context()` to return current context
- `nlohmann::crow::add_user_context(const json& data)` to add data to the user context
- `nlohmann::crow::add_tags_context(const json& data)` to add data to the tags context
- `nlohmann::crow::add_request_context(const json& data)` to add data to the request context
- `nlohmann::crow::add_extra_context(const json& data)` to add data to the extra context
- `nlohmann::crow::merge_context(const json& context)` to merge context information
- `nlohmann::crow::clear_context()` to reset context

See [the documentation](https://nlohmann.github.io/crow/classnlohmann_1_1crow.html) for a complete overview of the public API.

## Requirements for Sentry SDKs

The following items from [the SDK implementation guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/clientdev/overview/#writing-an-sdk) are realized at the moment:

- The following items are expected of production-ready SDKs:
    - [x] DSN configuration
    - [ ] Graceful failures (e.g. Sentry server is unreachable)
    - [x] Setting attributes (e.g. tags and extra data)
    - [x] Support for Linux, Windows and OS X (where applicable)
- Feature based support is required for the following:
    - [ ] If cookie data is available, it’s not sent by default
    - [ ] If POST data is available, it’s not sent by default
- Additionally, the following features are highly encouraged:
    - [x] Automated error capturing (e.g. uncaught exception handlers)
    - [x] Logging framework integration
    - [x] Non-blocking event submission
    - [ ] Basic data sanitization (e.g. filtering out values that look like passwords)
    - [x] Context data helpers (e.g. setting the current user, recording breadcrumbs)
    - [ ] Event sampling
    - [ ] Honor Sentry’s HTTP 429 Retry-After header
    - [ ] Pre and Post event send hooks
    - [ ] Local variable values in stacktrace (on platforms where this is possible)

## Prerequisites

You need [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/), [zlib](https://zlib.net), and a C++11 compiler to use the library.
Curl should be detected by CMake. If this does not work, you can download [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
and [zlib](https://zlib.net) and pass the path to the source release folder to CMake via
`-DCROW_EXTERNAL_CURL_PROJECT=curl-7.61.0` and `-DCROW_EXTERNAL_ZLIB_PROJECT=zlib-1.2.11`.
This libcurl and zlib is then built and linked.

## Used third-party tools

The library itself consists of a single header file licensed under the MIT license. However, it is built, tested, documented, and whatnot using a lot of third-party tools and services. Thanks a lot!

- [**Artistic Style**](http://astyle.sourceforge.net) for automatic source code identation
- [**Cmake**](https://cmake.org) for build automation
- [**Doxygen**](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to generate documentation
- [**JSON for Modern C++**](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to use JSON datatypes inside C++
- [**libcurl**](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) for HTTP communication with the Sentry servers
